Some translations may be wrong because some Chinese characters cannot be translated directly/ untranslatable into English.

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,060
loiter along the way

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,220
follow the traces of drifting teenagers

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,440
just before stepping out of the station

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,520
feel a little bit hesitated

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,860
ridicule about the 'Jin Xiang Qing Qie' (The shorter distance you approach the hometown, the more uncalm you are.)

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,980
is inevitable

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,360
and the sky of Nagano

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,260
still so warm

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
the wind is blowing to the people to memories of the past

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
the first met of this world

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,760
nostalgia

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,580
looking at the horizon, as if in front of you

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,660
I'm willing to go through it again

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,480
now I had been experienced this world

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,440
still nostalgia

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,180
realized that the side face was covered with wrinkles

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,160
caught off guard, invaded by your smile

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,400
I used to be unable to extricate myself from the world

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,580
and also indulge in daydreams

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,800
whether it's true or not, don't struggle, don't be afraid of others sneering at you

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,460
I used to be turned my youth into her

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,760
and used to be popped up the midsummer at my fingertips

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,300
the heart has been fallen in love, just fade with the fate

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,160
retrograde the light, let the wind and rain

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,020
loiter in a short way

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,120
make us far from each other

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,460
I don't know if it is experiencing a story or an emotion.

30
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,180
perhaps your expectation will be depleted by the time

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,840
see her again

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
in the morning with slightly cool's sunlight

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,700
she smiled sweetly

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,620
the first met of this world

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,520
nostalgia

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
looking at the horizon, as if in front of you

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm willing to go through it again

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,980
now I had been experienced this world

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,320
still nostalgia

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,180
realized that the side face was covered with wrinkles

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,060
caught off guard, invaded by your smile

42
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,140
I used to be unable to extricate myself from the world

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,320
and also indulge in daydreams

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,920
whether it's true or not, don't struggle, don't be afraid of others sneering at you

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,420
I used to be turned my youth into her

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,620
and used to be popped up the midsummer at my fingertips

47
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,940
the heart has been fallen in love, just fade with the fate

48
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,260
the night breeze blows the white hair between your temples

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,540
and heal the scars left by my memories

50
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,540
the light and dark mixed in your eyes

51
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,160
once you laugh, it's like a flower blooming

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
twilight covered your totter pace

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,220
and step into the hidden picture on the bed

54
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,880
in the picture that draws, you are bowing your head and whispering

55
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,360
I still sigh of this world

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
and also indulge in the love word in childhood

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,860
there is no true or false, no more struggle and joke

58
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,100
I finally gave back my youth to her

59
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,920
together with the midsummer that popped up at my fingertips

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,320
the heart has been fallen in love, just go with the wind

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:39,460
Do you still willing to be with me in the name of love?
